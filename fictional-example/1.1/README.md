# Fictional example

A work-in-progress fictional example designed to demonstrate the key features of OCDS.

These examples were generated from the [OCDS 1.1 Sample Data Spreadsheet Input Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P-q5S8-WUxYT6t8uVuZDvnGfsl39DhhZV_GvgR1GKHk/edit#gid=159397949). To update the examples, edit the spreadsheet input template and export using the `exportIndividualReleases` Google Apps script associated with the spreadsheet. This generates the individual XLSX releases that can be converted into JSON using the OCDS Validator and merged into a record using the merge tool.
