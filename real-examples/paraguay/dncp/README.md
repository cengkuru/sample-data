Paraguay Open Contracting Data
==============================

The [National Directorate of Public Procurement of The Republic of Paraguay (DNCP)](https://www.contrataciones.gov.py/) provide an Open Contracting API onto their data, [documented here](https://www.contrataciones.gov.py/datos/open-contracting-info). The API is [documented here](https://www.contrataciones.gov.py/datos/api/v2/).

The fetch script collects a list of available contracting identifiers, and then fetches the **compiled releases** for these by default. You can supply the `-r` argument to fetch individual releases as well as compiled releases:

    python fetch.py -r
